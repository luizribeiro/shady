Shady is a typed scripting language designed for system automation and command orchestration. It combines the expressiveness of traditional shell scripts with a robust type system and first-class process management.

## Why Shady?

Traditional shell scripts are powerful but lack type safety and structured process management. Shady addresses these limitations by providing:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors before runtime with a static type system (int, str, bool, list, proc)
- **First-Class Processes**: Process handles (`Proc` type) with built-in support for stdin/stdout/stderr redirection
- **Automatic CLI Generation**: Public functions become CLI subcommands automatically with proper argument parsing
- **Clean Syntax**: Readable, structured syntax with support for comments, conditionals, and expressions
- **Seamless External Commands**: Call any external command as if it were a native function

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Enter development environment (requires Nix with devenv)
devenv shell

# Build shady
cargo build

# Run a script
cargo run -- examples/example.shady
```

### Your First Script

Create a file `hello.shady`:

```shady
# Simple function that prints a greeting using string interpolation
public greet $name: str = print "Hello, {$name}!";

# Combines type safety with external command execution
public greet-uppercase $name: str =
  exec (echo "Hello, {$name}!" > tr "a-z" "A-Z");
```

Run it as a CLI:

```bash
./shady hello.shady greet "World"              # Hello, World!
./shady hello.shady greet-uppercase "World"    # HELLO, WORLD!
```

## Features

### Type System

Shady supports the following types:

- `int` - 64-bit integers
- `str` - UTF-8 strings
- `bool` - Boolean values
- `[T]` - Lists of any type
- `proc` - Process handles with I/O streams

```shady
# Type-safe calculator with proper precedence
public calculate $x: int $y: int -> int =
  ($x + $y) * 2 ^ 3;  # Returns ($x + $y) * 8

# Type errors are caught at parse/eval time
public safe-divide $a: int $b: int -> int =
  if ($b == 0)
    0  # Return 0 for division by zero
  else
    $a / $b;
```

### String Interpolation

Embed expressions directly in strings using `{expr}` syntax. Any expression can be interpolated, and the result is automatically converted to a string:

```shady
# Simple variable interpolation
public greet $name: str = print "Hello, {$name}!";

# Arithmetic expressions
public show-result $x: int $y: int =
  print "{$x} + {$y} = {$x + $y}";

# Nested expressions and function calls
public deployment-status $version: str $server: str =
  print "Deploying v{$version} to {$server} at {stdout (date +%H:%M)}";

# Boolean expressions
public check-value $x: int =
  print "Value {$x} is {if ($x > 10) "large" else "small"}";

# Mix interpolation with literals
public format-list $count: int =
  print "Found {$count} item{if ($count == 1) "" else "s"}";
```

String interpolation makes string building more readable compared to concatenation:

```shady
# Before (string concatenation)
print ("User " + $name + " logged in at " + (stdout (date)));

# After (string interpolation)
print "User {$name} logged in at {stdout (date)}";
```

### Process Management

External commands are first-class citizens. Shady automatically spawns processes and provides access to their streams:

```shady
# Capture and process command output
public get-git-branch = stdout (git branch --show-current);

# Chain processes with type-safe redirection
public count-errors $logfile: str =
  stdout (cat $logfile > grep "ERROR" > wc -l);

# Compose complex pipelines naturally
public top-committers =
  stdout (
    git log --format="%an" >
    sort >
    uniq -c >
    sort -rn >
    head -5
  );

# Mix typed data with process output
public deploy-info $version: str =
  print "Deploying version {$version} to {get-git-branch}";
```

### Sequential Execution

Use `seq` to orchestrate complex workflows:

```shady
# Automated deployment pipeline
public deploy $server: str $version: str = seq [
  echo "Starting deployment of v{$version} to {$server}";
  git fetch --tags;
  git checkout $version;
  cargo test;
  cargo build --release;
  scp target/release/app $server:/opt/app/app-new;
  ssh $server "mv /opt/app/app /opt/app/app-old && mv /opt/app/app-new /opt/app/app";
  ssh $server sudo systemctl restart app;
  echo "Deployment complete!";
];

# Database backup with verification
public backup-database $name: str = seq [
  pg_dump $name > /backups/$name.sql;
  gzip /backups/$name.sql;
  echo ("Backup size: " + (stdout (du -h /backups/$name.sql.gz > awk "{print $1}")));
];
```

### Conditional Expressions

```shady
# If expressions are values, enabling functional composition
public max $a: int $b: int -> int =
  if ($a > $b) $a else $b;

# Smart deployment based on environment
public deploy-to-env $env: str =
  if ($env == "prod")
    seq [
      echo "Deploying to production - running full test suite...";
      cargo test;
      cargo build --release;
      ssh prod-server "systemctl stop app";
      scp target/release/app prod-server:/opt/app/;
      ssh prod-server "systemctl start app";
    ]
  else
    seq [
      echo "Deploying to staging - quick deploy";
      cargo build;
      scp target/debug/app staging-server:/opt/app/;
      ssh staging-server "systemctl restart app";
    ];

# Conditional string formatting
public format-count $count: int =
  print (
    (to_string $count) +
    (if ($count == 1) " item" else " items")
  );
```

### Automatic CLI Generation

Public functions automatically become CLI subcommands with proper argument parsing:

```shady
# Default values make parameters optional
public serve
  $port: int (8080, option)
  $host: str ("localhost", option)
= seq [
  echo "Starting server on {$host}:{$port}";
  python3 -m http.server $port --bind $host;
];

# Multiple optional parameters with sensible defaults
public docker-build
  $name: str
  $tag: str ("latest", option)
  $platform: str ("linux/amd64", option)
= exec (docker build -t $name:$tag --platform $platform .);
```

Use from the command line:

```bash
# Use defaults
./script.shady serve
# Starting server on localhost:8080

# Override specific options
./script.shady serve --port 3000 --host "0.0.0.0"
# Starting server on 0.0.0.0:3000

# Required and optional parameters
./script.shady docker-build myapp --tag "v1.2.3"
```

### Recursion and Private Functions

```shady
# Private helper for recursive computation (not exposed to CLI)
factorial_impl $n: int $acc: int -> int =
  if ($n <= 1)
    $acc
  else
    factorial_impl ($n - 1) ($acc * $n);

# Public interface with nice output
public factorial $n: int =
  print "{$n}! = {factorial_impl $n 1}";

# Recursive file processing
count_lines_impl $files: [str] $total: int -> int =
  if ((first $files) == "")
    $total
  else
    count_lines_impl
      (rest $files)
      ($total + (stdout (wc -l (first $files) > awk "{print $1}")));

public count-project-lines =
  print (
    "Total lines: " +
    (to_string (count_lines_impl (lines (find . -name "*.rs")) 0))
  );
```

### List Operations

```shady
# List literals use semicolon separators
public sum-numbers = print (to_string (add_all [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]));  # 15

# Lists from CLI are comma-separated
public batch-process $files: [str] = seq [
  echo ("Processing " + (to_string (add_all [1])) + " files...");
  first $files;  # Process first file
  # In future: map over $files
];

# Combine lists with process output
public analyze-git-files $extensions: [str] =
  lines (
    find . -name ("*." + (first $extensions))
      -not -path "./.git/*"
  );

# Dynamic list building from command output
public modified-files =
  lines (git diff --name-only);
```

Call from CLI:

```bash
# Lists are comma-separated
./script.shady batch-process "main.rs,lib.rs,mod.rs"

# Multiple extensions
./script.shady analyze-git-files "rs,toml"
```

### Environment Variables

```shady
# Access environment variables with defaults
public get-editor = env "EDITOR" "vim";

# Build dynamic paths from environment
public backup-to-home $filename: str =
  exec (cp $filename ((env "HOME" "/tmp") + "/backup/" + $filename));

# Environment-aware configuration
public configure =
  if ((env "ENV" "dev") == "prod")
    echo "Using production config"
  else
    echo "Using development config";
```

## Real-World Examples

### Infrastructure Management

```shady
# Multi-server deployment with health checks
public deploy-cluster $version: str = seq [
  echo ("Deploying " + $version + " to cluster");

  # Deploy to each server with health check
  ssh web1 "docker pull myapp:" + $version;
  ssh web1 "docker-compose up -d";
  curl -f https://web1.example.com/health;

  ssh web2 "docker pull myapp:" + $version;
  ssh web2 "docker-compose up -d";
  curl -f https://web2.example.com/health;

  echo "Cluster deployment complete!";
];

# Automated backup with rotation
public backup-all = seq [
  echo ("Starting backup at " + (stdout (date +%Y-%m-%d)));
  pg_dump production > /backups/db-(stdout (date +%Y%m%d)).sql;
  tar czf /backups/files-(stdout (date +%Y%m%d)).tar.gz /var/www;
  find /backups -mtime +30 -delete;
  echo ("Backup complete. Total size: " +
        (stdout (du -sh /backups > awk "{print $1}")));
];
```

### Development Workflow Automation

```shady
# Pre-commit validation
public pre-commit = seq [
  echo "Running pre-commit checks...";
  cargo fmt --check;
  cargo clippy -- -D warnings;
  cargo test;
  echo "All checks passed!";
];

# Smart test runner with coverage
public test-with-coverage $pattern: str ("", option) = seq [
  if ($pattern == "")
    cargo test
  else
    cargo test $pattern;
  cargo tarpaulin --out Html;
  echo ("Coverage report: " + (stdout (pwd)) + "/tarpaulin-report.html");
];

# Release automation
public release $version: str = seq [
  echo ("Preparing release " + $version);
  git tag -a $version -m ("Release " + $version);
  cargo build --release;
  cargo publish;
  git push origin $version;
  gh release create $version target/release/app;
];
```

### Log Analysis and Monitoring

```shady
# Real-time error monitoring
public watch-errors $logfile: str =
  exec (tail -f $logfile > grep --color=always "ERROR");

# Aggregate error counts by type
public error-summary $logfile: str =
  stdout (
    cat $logfile >
    grep "ERROR" >
    awk "{print $5}" >
    sort >
    uniq -c >
    sort -rn
  );

# Alert on threshold
public check-error-rate $logfile: str $threshold: int = seq [
  echo "Checking error rate...";
  if ((stdout (cat $logfile > grep -c "ERROR")) > $threshold)
    seq [
      echo "ALERT: Error threshold exceeded!";
      curl -X POST https://alerts.example.com/webhook;
    ]
  else
    echo "Error rate within normal limits";
];
```

## Planned Features

- Variadic functions
